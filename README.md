# crumbs

note taking in Vim - really only syntax highlighting. for my personal use.

## dependancies

requires [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

## features

* a limited four-color palette (black, white, grey and yellow).
* file detection for .crm extention.
* fixed-width formating mentality (tw=79).

## guidelines

### simple styling

* lowercase - it's just easier.
* use of color formating consistent with concepts of notes.
* use periods at ends of sentences (makes simplistic formating with indents and new lines more obvious).

### section headers

```
| item index											      ~ |
```

| char | function |
| - | - |
| ~ | intro section |
| + | working section |
| - | finished section |

(not fully decided upon)
